<h3> CODE AND FILES FOR THE PHYMOL INTERVIEW <h3>

In this repository are the files and codes that will be shown to the PHYMOL Commitee
<p>
data science: This is a data science module designed to facilitate the development of data science projects, some functions have importation of modules, this is because the function could be used as an all in other codes.
</p>

<p>
phosphate: This is the code that shows how the web layout of a data science project is made with python. You can see how it looks on my personal web page https://exlonk.netlify.app/
</p>

<p>
preprocessing_pipeline: This is a little complex code, that was created to do different combinations of estimators and transformers for the preprocessing step in a data science project.
<p>

<p>
reactivity: This piece of code takes some gaussian files, extracts the Hirshfeld charges and made the calculation of some reactivity indexes, like the dual condensed descriptor, the fukui index, and the Anderson index, some of which were used in my thesis. The output of the script is an excel file like the reactivity.xlsx file in the repository. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, I have added the slides of my thesis and the thesis itself to this repository in case you would like to take a more in-depth look of my work. Also I added slides called numerical_methods about some methods that I implemented to solve the 1-D particle in a box with infinite potential (It was made in 2019)
</p>
<p>
Note 1: 
Dear PHYMOL committee, almost all of the code shown in this repository was not made with the intention of being shared or used by anyone. Only the phosphate code was made with the intention of being shown to another programmer as support of my work. Because of this, not all of the best coding practices were followed, such as thorough documentation or adhering to specific row width.

</p>

<p>
Note 2: 
Some fragments of code for the data science module were taken from external sources.
</p>

<p>
Note 3: All codes are highly susceptible to being improved, in specific the code (for the "for" loop) of the preprocessing pipeline could be improved using the itertool module.
</p>

<p>
Thanks a lot
